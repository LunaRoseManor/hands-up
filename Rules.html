<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>Decide who will act as the <strong>Chief</strong> for this game. The
other player is now the <strong>Robber</strong>. Have the
<strong>Chief</strong> read the following aloud: &gt; You‚Äôre walking
down a dark alleyway carrying a two-way radio, a stolen diamond and a
loaded pistol. The radio is tuned to a dock worker, who has agreed to
lend her boat to the heist of the century, if only you‚Äôd make it there
in time. Suddenly, a police officer shines a bright light in your face,
illuminating a nearby fire escape. &gt; ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre under arrest. Hands
up!‚Äô</p>
<p>The <strong>Robber</strong> starts with three ‚ù§Ô∏è
<strong>Health</strong> and three üî• <strong>Heat</strong>. Both players
should raise three fingers of their non-dominant hand to indicate this.
The <strong>Chief</strong> tracks üî• while the <strong>Robber</strong>
tracks their own ‚ù§Ô∏è.</p>
<h3 id="objective">Objective</h3>
<p>The objective of the game changes based on your chosen role: -
<strong>Robber:</strong> You win the game if you make it to the getaway
boat while holding the diamond, or the üî• reaches zero. -
<strong>Chief:</strong> Give the <strong>Robber</strong> the most
thrilling chase possible. If you do catch them, make it dramatic!</p>
<h3 id="turn-structure">Turn Structure</h3>
<p>The game from the <strong>Robber</strong>‚Äôs perspective looks like
this: - <strong>Tension Phase:</strong> Listen to the
<strong>Chief</strong> and try to imagine the situation they describe. -
<strong>Action Phase:</strong> Tell the <strong>Chief</strong> how you
want to respond. This can be anything you can think of, so long as it
furthers your objective. Resolution Phase: If the
<strong>Robber</strong>‚Äôs proposed solution was risky, play Rock, Paper,
Scissors: - <strong>Robber Wins:</strong> Their plan goes off without a
hitch. -1üî• - <strong>Tie</strong>: They succeed, but there‚Äôs one slight
problem. You don‚Äôt gain or lose üî• - <strong>Chief Wins</strong>: They
don‚Äôt get what you want and things get worse +1üî•</p>
<p>Whatever happens, this becomes the scenario described in the next
tension phase.</p>
<h3 id="additional-rules">Additional Rules</h3>
<h4 id="stealth">Stealth</h4>
<p>The robber may choose to hide from the police instead of taking them
head on. They aren‚Äôt able to do this where a police officer or bystander
would reasonably be able to see or hear them, who will snitch on them
instantly. Otherwise -1üî•</p>
<h4 id="cool">Cool</h4>
<p>If the <strong>Chief</strong> agrees what the robber attempts is
<em>awesome</em>, throw twice and take the better result in favour of
the robber.</p>
<h4 id="heat">Heat</h4>
<p>Starts at three and changes depending on your actions. If it ever
reaches five, the <strong>Chief</strong> and the robber engage in a
thumb war: - <strong>Robber Wins:</strong> The robber is handcuffed and
immediately loses the game. - <strong>Chief Wins:</strong> A stroke of
luck allows the robber to escape. Continue play with üî• set to four
instead of five.</p>
<h4 id="death">Death</h4>
<p>You can survive damage only twice. The first destroys your body
armour. The second gives you an injury that prevents you from throwing
more than once per turn. The last one kills you.</p>
<h3 id="setting">Setting</h3>
<p>Drundleton Upon Sea. This sleepy English coastal town is a gently
sloping mess of sudden cliffs, winding roads and wonky buildings that
smell faintly of smoke. It has the following points of interest: - The
Museum of Rock: A local attraction seeking to educate the public about
hard candy. Its most recent exibition exposed a critical flaw in the
laser defense system. Currently swarming with police officers. - Pearl
Clutch Marina: Home to a vast shipping yard containing everything from
aging tugboats to towering ocean liners. - Dinosand Amusement Park: A
small family park where the titular dinosaurs have been an upcoming
attraction for a while now. Has a surprisingly intense rollercoaster. -
Markoff Tower: While folk are barred from climbing it, this enormous
clock tower acts as an anchor point for tourists and locals alike. -
Drundleton Pier: While a thrilling feat of engineering a hundred years
ago, this mile long pier burned down in a bizarre accident and is said
to be haunted. The robber doesn‚Äôt have to be aware of all of these
locations before playing, as these can be organically explained by the
<strong>Chief</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="force">Force</h3>
<p>The police will stop at nothing to get the museum‚Äôs diamond back. If
the chase becomes stuck, the <strong>Chief</strong> can use one of the
following abilities during the tension phase to keep the story moving: -
<strong>Smoke:</strong> A smoke grenade is tossed into the
<strong>Robber</strong>‚Äôs location, making it hard to breathe and
restricting their vision. - <strong>Kaboom:</strong> Something nearby
explodes and bursts into flames! - <strong>Rainstorm:</strong> An
armoured vehicle smashes its way on the scene, its water cannon primed
to send the <strong>Robber</strong> tumbling into the gutter. -
<strong>Charge:</strong> A mighty white stallion gallops towards the
<strong>Robber</strong>, intent on trampling them. On its back are two
riot officers armed with net cannons. - <strong>Unleash:</strong> A
couple of highly-trained german shepherds are let loose on the town,
trained on the <strong>Robber</strong>‚Äôs scent. Be careful not to
overuse these as they can make things unfair or unrealistic for the
<strong>Robber</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="playing-as-the-chief">Playing as the Chief</h3>
<p>When running a session of Hands Up, you have a number of
responsibilities: 1. <strong>Be a fan of the Robber.</strong> Give them
cool action movie situations to react to and try to make the police seem
like more than simply a rule you‚Äôre following. 2. <strong>Give evocative
descriptions.</strong> Keep them short, snappy and sharply focused on
whatever interactable object happens to be nearby while involving more
senses that mere sight. 3. <strong>Be humble.</strong> Don‚Äôt be afraid
to make mistakes and ask the <strong>Robber</strong> for help when you
get stuck. 4. <strong>Listen closely.</strong> <strong>Robbers</strong>
are more likely to get frustrated if you enforce your idea of the story
on them instead of letting them contribute their fair share. 5.
<strong>Don‚Äôt take it too seriously!</strong> Unless you happen to be a
professional actor, you‚Äôre almost certainly not going to sound
convincing in your role, which is fine and to be expected.</p>
<p>Reading the rules before starting is highly desired, but not
required.</p>
