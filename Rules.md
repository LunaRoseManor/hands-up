# Hands Up
## A Diceless Diamond Heist

### Setup
Decide who will act as the chief for this game. The other player is now the robber. Have the chief read the following aloud:
> You're walking down a dark alleyway carrying a two-way radio, a stolen diamond and a loaded pistol. The radio is tuned to a dock worker, who has agreed to lend her boat to the heist of the century, if only you'd make it there in time. Suddenly, a police officer shines a bright light in your face, illuminating a nearby fire escape.
> "You're under arrest. Hands up!'

The robber starts with three ‚ù§Ô∏è **health** and three üî• **heat**. Both players should raise three fingers of their non-dominant hand to indicate this. The chief tracks üî• while the robber tracks their own ‚ù§Ô∏è.

### Objective
The objective of the game changes based on your chosen role:
- **Robber:** You win the game if you make it to the getaway boat while holding the diamond, or the üî• reaches zero.
- **Chief:** Give the robber the most thrilling chase possible. If you do catch them, make it dramatic!

### Turn Structure
The game from the robber's perspective looks like this:
- **Tension Phase:** Listen to the chief and try to imagine the situation they describe.
- **Action Phase:** Tell the chief how you want to respond. This can be anything you can think of, so long as it furthers your objective.
Resolution Phase: If the robber's proposed solution was risky, play rock paper scissors:
    - **Robber Wins:** Their plan goes off without a hitch. -1üî•
    - **Tie**: They succeed, but there's one slight problem. You don't gain or lose üî•
    - **Chief Wins**: They don't get what you want and things get worse +1üî•

Whatever happens, this becomes the scenario described in the next tension phase.

### Additional Rules
#### Teleportation
The robber can't suggest anything that would instantly transport them to a location, especially the getaway boat. Otherwise, there'd be no game!

#### Stealth
The robber may choose to hide from the police instead of taking them head on. They aren't able to do this where a police officer or bystander would reasonably be able to see or hear them, who will snitch on them instantly. Otherwise, the robber loses 1üî•

#### Cool
If the chief agrees what the robber attempts is *awesome*, throw twice and take the better result in favour of the robber.

#### Heat
Starts at three and changes depending on your actions. If it ever reaches five, the chief and the robber engage in a thumb war:
- **Robber Wins:** The robber is handcuffed and immediately loses the game.
- **Chief Wins:** A stroke of luck allows the robber to escape. Continue play with üî• set to four instead of five.

#### Death
You can survive damage only twice. The first destroys your body armour. The second gives you an injury that prevents you from throwing more than once per turn. The last one kills you.

### Setting
Drundleton Upon Sea. This sleepy English coastal town is a gently sloping mess of sudden cliffs, winding roads and wonky buildings that smell faintly of smoke. It has the following points of interest:
- The Museum of Rock: A local attraction seeking to educate the public about hard candy. Its most recent exibition exposed a critical flaw in the laser defense system. Currently swarming with police officers.
- Pearl End Marina: Home to a vast shipping yard containing everything from aging  to towering ocean liners.
- Dinosand Amusement Park: A small family park where the titular dinosaurs have been an upcoming attraction for a while now. Has a surprisingly intense rollercoaster.
- Markoff Tower: While folk are barred from climbing it, this enormous clock tower acts as an anchor point for tourists and locals alike.
- Drundleton Pier: While a thrilling feat of engineering a hundred years ago, this mile long pier burned down in a bizarre accident and is said to be haunted.
The robber doesn't have to be aware of all of these locations before playing, as these can be organically explained by the chief.

### Force
The police will stop at nothing to get the museum's diamond back. If the chase becomes stuck, the chief can use one of the following abilities during the tension phase to keep the story moving:
- **Smoke:** A smoke grenade is tossed into the robber's location, making it hard to breathe and restricting their vision.
- **Kaboom:** Something nearby explodes and bursts into flames!
- **Rainstorm:** An armoured vehicle smashes its way on the scene, its water cannon primed to send the robber tumbling into the gutter.
- **Charge:** A mighty white stallion gallops towards the robber, intent on trampling them. On its back are two riot officers armed with net cannons.
- **Unleash:** A couple of highly-trained german shepards are let loose on the town, trained on the robber's scent.
Be careful not to overuse these as they can make things unfair or unrealistic for the robber.

### Playing as the Chief
When running a session of Hands Up, you have a number of responsibilities:
1. **Be a fan of the robber.** Give them cool action movie situations to react to and try to make the police seem like more than simply a rule you're following.
2. **Give evocative descriptions.** Keep them short, snappy and sharply focused on whatever interactable object happens to be nearby while involving more senses that mere sight.
3. **Be humble.** Don't be afraid to make mistakes and ask the robber for help when you get stuck.
4. **Listen closely.** Robbers are more likely to get frustrated if you enforce your idea of the story on them instead of letting them contribute their fair share.
5. **Don't take it too seriously!** Unless you happen to be a professional actor, you're almost certainly not going to sound convincing in your role, which is fine and to be expected.

Reading the rules before starting is highly desired, but not required.
