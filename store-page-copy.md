Hands Up is a diceless, two-page crime rpg for two players:
- One of you is a *robber* looking to steal a priceless diamond.
- The other player takes on the role of the *chief* trying to get it back.

Together, you'll go on a chase that neither of you will forget in a hurry.

# Features
- **Handheld Skill Resolution:** play standing up while waiting in line without any table or extra equipment!
- **Original setting:** visit the crumbling seaside haven of Drundleton on Sea, complete with its own map.
- **Adaptive Difficulty:** Feel the heat as you charge through tear gas, tense sniper duels and a giant police mech.
- **Prepless:** No need for careful planning, just print the PDF and get right into the action!
- **Rules-lite:** Trivially easy to pick up and play while still being adaptible.

# Ethos
 It can be hard to explain the appeal of TTRPGs to someone who's never played them before. What the genre needs is something you can keep stowed in your back pocket and play *right now*. While the game works well as a solid 1-2 hour experience, it's best deployed as an educational microgame whenever the talk of your exciting adventures into kobold infested barrow mounds and haunted Rhode Island libraries occurs on a lunch break.

 This game is not an endorsement of policing in any way, shape or form. Black lives matter.
