Hands Up is a diceless, two-page crime rpg for two players:
- One of you is a *Robber* looking to steal a priceless diamond.
- The other player takes on the role of the *Director* egging them on.

Together, you'll go on a chase neither of you will forget in a hurry.

# Features
- **Handheld Skill Resolution:** Play standing up without any table or extra equipment!
- **Original setting:** Visit the crumbling seaside haven of Drundleton on Sea, complete with its own map.
- **Adaptive Difficulty:** Feel the heat as you charge through tear gas, tense sniper duels and a giant police mech.
- **Prepless:** No need for careful planning, just print the PDF and get right into the action!
- **Rules-lite:** Trivially easy to pick up and play while still being adaptable.

# Ethos
Hands Up is designed to be folded into your back pocket to run *right now*. It's a rock solid, educational microgame playable over a lunch break, acting as a tight sales pitch for anyone who might have overlooked an exciting hobby.

*NOTE: This game is not an endorsement of policing in any way, shape or form. All cops are bastards. Defund the police. Black lives matter. If this notice bothers you, I don't want your time nor money.*
